# ViaEagler

This plugin gives compatibility with ViaVersion and Eaglercraft, since ViaVersion 5.7.1 removed reflection systems, which broke EaglerXServer and Eaglercraft clients. This plugin requires Java 17+ and modern/newer versions of ViaVersion and EaglerXServer.

This plugin is in development and will be released soon. Stay Tuned!
